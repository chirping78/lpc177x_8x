@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use RS485 functionality on UART of LPC1788
		in master mode.
	Process:	
		RS485 function on UART1 acts as Master mode on RS485 bus.
		Master device will send a specified slave device address value
		first, then master device will send data frames. After sending
		completed, master device wait for response from slave device (example RS485_slave).

	Uart_Rs485Master.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				Jumpers: Optional
				
		RS485 Connection:
			Pls see the 'Transceiver_Master.png' in this directory for wiring information.			
				
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Connect RS485 as above instruction (using ADM485)
		- Step 5: Run example and using Serial display to monitor the communication between master and slave.
